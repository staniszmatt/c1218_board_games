# Board Gamers

This is an app for people who love playing board games to meet other people who have the same passion. 
You can look through a list of events within your area. This app will allow you to join their game, meet new people, and have fun. 
You can also host events so that people can try out games that they do not have yet.

### App Functionality

Data is passed back and forth through an Apache server using PHP, being displayed on the front end with React and Redux.
